# Slot UI

Beautiful components. Full control. Zero lock-in. Grab, customize, ship.

Slot UI is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components built on top of [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Inspired by [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), it follows the same open-code philosophy.

## Features

- Built on [Base UI](https://base-ui.com) primitives for production-grade accessibility
- Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- Open code — components live in your project, not in `node_modules`
- Dark mode support out of the box
- Three corner shape modes: round, square, and squircle
- Compatible with the [shadcn CLI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli) for easy installation
- AI-ready — consistent, readable structure for AI tools

## Installation
