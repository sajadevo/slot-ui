## Prerequisites

Slot UI components require a React project with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a> installed.

## Adding Components

You can add components using the CLI or manually by copying the source code.

### With the shadcn CLI

Slot UI uses the <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli" target="_blank">shadcn CLI</a> for component distribution. Each component page includes a command that handles installation, dependencies, and styling for you:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://slot-ui.com/r/button.json
```

To install all components at once:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://slot-ui.com/r/ui.json
```

### Manually

1. Install <a href="https://base-ui.com/react/overview/quick-start" target="_blank" className="font-medium underline underline-offset-4">Base UI</a> in your project
2. Find the component you need on the components page
3. Switch to the **Manual** tab in the installation section
4. Copy the source code into your project (e.g. `components/ui/button.tsx`)
5. Install all the required dependencies
6. Import and use the component

## Dark Mode

Slot UI includes dark mode support out of the box. If you're using `next-themes`, it works automatically.

## Corner Shape

Slot UI supports three corner shape modes via the `--shape` CSS variable:

```css
@theme {
  --shape: round; /* round | square | squircle */
}
```

- **round** — Standard rounded corners using traditional `border-radius`. This is the base default and works across all browsers.
- **square** — Sharp, straight corners with no rounding. Best suited for minimal, geometric, or brutalist design styles.
- **squircle** — Smooth superellipse corners that produce a continuous curvature, similar to iOS app icons. Uses the CSS `corner-shape` property for a more natural, organic feel compared to standard rounding.

Squircle corners are applied as a progressive enhancement. In browsers that support `corner-shape`, the shape is automatically upgraded to `squircle` with a larger base radius (`1rem` instead of `0.625rem`). In browsers that don't support it, the `@supports` block is ignored and components gracefully fall back to the `round` shape and base radius defined in `@theme`:

```css
@supports (corner-shape: round) {
  :root {
    --shape: squircle;
    --radius: 1rem;
  }
}
```

Slot UI provides a `corner-shape` Tailwind utility class that applies the selected shape:

```css
@utility corner-shape {
  corner-shape: var(--shape);
}
```

Use it on any element:

```html
<div className="rounded-md corner-shape">...</div>
```

### Changing the Shape

To use a different shape, set the `--shape` variable in your `@theme` and override the `@supports` block so it doesn't switch to `squircle`:

```css
@theme {
  --shape: square; /* or round */
}

@supports (corner-shape: round) {
  :root {
    --shape: square; /* keep the same shape even in supported browsers */
  }
}
```

If you want `squircle` everywhere (the default behavior), you don't need to change anything — it's already handled automatically via the `@supports` block.
