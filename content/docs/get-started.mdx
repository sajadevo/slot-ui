## Prerequisites

Slot UI components require a React project with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) installed.

## Adding Components

You can add components using the CLI or manually by copying the source code.

### With the shadcn CLI

Slot UI uses the <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli" target="_blank">shadcn CLI</a> for component distribution. Each component page includes a command that handles installation, dependencies, and styling for you:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @slot/button
```

To install all components at once:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add @slot/ui
```

### Manually

1. Install <a href="https://base-ui.com/react/overview/quick-start" target="_blank" className="font-medium underline underline-offset-4">Base UI</a> in your project
2. Find the component you need on the components page
3. Switch to the **Manual** tab in the installation section
4. Copy the source code into your project (e.g. `components/ui/button.tsx`)
5. Install all the required dependencies
6. Import and use the component

## Dark Mode

Slot UI includes dark mode support out of the box. If you're using `next-themes`, it works automatically.

## Corner Shape

Slot UI supports three corner shape modes via the `--shape` CSS variable:

```css
@theme {
  --shape: squircle; /* round | square | squircle */
}
```

- **round**: Standard rounded corners using traditional `border-radius`. The most common and widely supported shape across all browsers.
- **square**: Sharp, straight corners with no rounding. Best suited for minimal, geometric, or brutalist design styles.
- **squircle**: Smooth superellipse corners that produce a continuous curvature, similar to iOS app icons. This is the default shape in Slot UI and uses the CSS `corner-shape` property for a more natural, organic feel compared to standard rounding.
