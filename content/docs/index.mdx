Slot UI is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable components built on top of <a href="https://base-ui.com" target="_blank">Base UI</a> and <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">Tailwind CSS</a>. Inspired by <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com" target="_blank">shadcn/ui</a>, it follows the same open-code philosophy — you get the source code, you own it, you customize it, you ship it.

It is not a component library you install as a dependency. It's how you build your component library.

## Why Slot UI

Most component libraries give you pre-packaged components behind a `node_modules` wall. When you need to change something, you're fighting the library — overriding styles, wrapping components, or forking the package.

Slot UI takes a different approach. Every component is a file in your project. You can read it, modify it, and extend it however you want.

## Built on Base UI

<a href="https://base-ui.com" target="_blank">Base UI</a> provides unstyled, accessible primitives that handle the hard parts — keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support. Slot UI layers thoughtful design and sensible defaults on top.

This means you get production-grade accessibility out of the box, without being locked into someone else's design decisions.

## How It Works

Components are added to your project using the CLI or by copying the source code directly.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://slot-ui.com/r/button.json
```

This places the component source code in your project. From there, it's yours — update the styles, change the variants, add new props, or rewrite it entirely.

## Principles

### Open Code

The component code lives in your project. No wrappers, no abstractions, no hidden magic. You can read every line, understand every decision, and change anything.

### Composable

Components follow a consistent, composable API. They're built to work together and are predictable to use. If you know one component, you know them all.

### Beautiful Defaults

Every component ships with carefully crafted styles that work cohesively. They look great out of the box, but they're designed to be customized.

### Accessible

Built on Base UI primitives, every component follows WAI-ARIA patterns and supports keyboard navigation, screen readers, and focus management by default.

### AI-Ready

Because the code lives in your project and follows a consistent, readable structure, AI tools can easily understand, modify, and generate new components based on existing patterns.
